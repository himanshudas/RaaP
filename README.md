# Recon as a Platform (RaaP)?

![](https://i.imgflip.com/5kk95o.jpg)

## Assumptions
- You do not know a tool/data already exists for an action or specific set of actions. Example (subdomain enumeration)
- You know a tool/data exists but has shortcomings in context of performance or feature sets. Example (support for subdomain scraping from a specific platform)
- You are missing on unknowns because you were not aware about extending/enriching your results using another set of tools/data. Example (mutating subdomains to gather valid set of new results )
- Your choice of system design is limited to solve for small set of user inputs but cannot scale. Example (bash script vs infrastructure as a code)
- You can't recall what was the reconnaissance flow you followed last time.


## How to use this project?
- You want to benchmark multiple projects solving for specific problem. Example (subdomain takeovers)
- You want to refer this project whenever you want to add feature sets to your existing reconnaissance platform/projects. Example (ssrf exploitation)
- You want to keep this project as a reference whenever you are attempting for a manual reconnaissance.
- You want to build your own ultimate reconnaissance platform but do not want to spend time in researching about existing toolsets.
